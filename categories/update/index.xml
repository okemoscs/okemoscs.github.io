      <description>Okemos CS Club will be continuing this year. We are planning on competing in the governor&amp;rsquo;s cybersecurity challenge, MHacks, and Spartahack. I have not come up with a first meeting date and time quite yet, so watch for it on the website. I will try and announce it in school, and I will put up posters for it. We will most likely have a few meetings in September just for the Cybersecurity Challenge and for MHacks.</description>

      <description>The year is now drawing to a close. This year, Okemos CS Club went to Spartahack, where we competed, and many of our members learned basic programming skills. Next year, we will be going to both MHacks, Spartahack, and we will be competiting in the governor&amp;rsquo;s cyber security challenge. I reccomend learning some of the basics of cybersecurity if you wish to participate.
Next year, our meetings will be every Tuesday, from 2:45 to 3:45.</description>

      <description>Our first meeting is on Oct. 11th. This meeting will probably be about 30 minutes to give new members a good idea of what this club is about.
